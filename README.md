## The game idea

**Overview:**

This VR game simulates how we are fighting the Covid-19 in an enjoyable way. In the game, we integrate some educational aspects to prevent Corona virus and save our lives such as washing hand by sanitizers, wearing face masks, or social distance. The game happens in a city with three class of characters: a monster, people on the street, and a player. The player needs to kill the monster before being killed to win the game.

After implementation phase, we slightly modify the idea with the replacement of sanitizers by vaccines.
