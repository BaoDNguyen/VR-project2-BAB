## The game idea

**Overview:**

This VR game simulates how we are fighting the Covid-19 in an enjoyable way. In the game, we integrate some educational aspects to prevent Corona virus and save our lives such as washing hand by sanitizers, wearing face masks, or social distance. The game happens in a city with three class of characters: a monster, people on the street, and a player. The player needs to kill the monster before being killed to win the game.

After implementation phase, we slightly modify the idea with the replacement of sanitizers by vaccines.

**Project evaluation:**

1. Innovative and Transformative (20%): we transform human fight again Covid-19 to a shooting VR game. Some facts related to Covid-19 are transformed to objects in game.

2. Educating (10%): the science behind our game: wearing mask and social distance can help avoid the damage from virus. The knowledge of wearing mask and social distance can be seen in below figures.

4. Visual appealing (10%): we can see buildings, the vaccine gun, people on the street with many visual details.

5. Sound effect (10%): real sounds to make the game more interesting: walking, the crowd yields, the monster's sound, ...

6. Usability (10%):the game can work smoothly.

7. Technical challenging (10%): all features/functions in the next section.
